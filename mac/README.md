# Installation guide for OSX
This is a poor man's attempt to set up a platform agnostic development environment
through overcomplicated shell scripts. Currently working mostly for macOS. Use
`General Setup` if you use other OS (Linux, Unix, BSD).  

Platform specific setups are described by separate section.

## [ï£¿] Prerequisites
* Make sure the executing user `echo $USER` has access to the following sub-directories in `/usr/local`  
(_NOTE: This is not an exhaustive list_):
    * `Caskroom`

    * `Frameworks`
    * `Homebrew`
    * `bin`
    * `include`
    * `lib`
    * `opt`
    * `sbin`
    * `share`
    * `var`
* You can ensure ownership with the following command: `sudo chown -R ${USER}:admin <dirs_listed_above>`
* Install [brew](https://brew.sh/)
* Follow brew post install instructions to populate `brew` in the environment

## Installation
