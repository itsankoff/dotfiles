# Installation guide for OSX
[WIP] This is poor man's attempt to set up a platform agnostic development environment
through overcomplicated shell scripts.

## General setup
* ðŸ“œ Run `setup.sh`
* â˜• Make yourself a coffee or a tea! **NOTE**: It is really important for the script!
* ðŸš€ Happy coding!

## Install AirPodsConnect
* Open Script Editor
* Copy the `AirPodsConnect` script in the editor
* Rename the `AirPods Pro` with yours AirPods's name. If you have apostrophe
    in your AirPods name, make sure it matches extacly in the script.
* Save the script in Applications with File Format `Application`
* Open Spotlight, type `AirPodsConnect` and hit enter
* Enjoy the ðŸŽ§

## Troubleshooting
* Depending on your Mac settings you may need to allow Accessibility permissions
    for the script. Go to `Settings -> Security and Privacy -> Privacy Tab -> Accessibility -> Add permission for AirPodsConnect`
